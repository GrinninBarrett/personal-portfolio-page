# Personal Portfolio Page

This repository is for my personal portfolio website, which I am in the beginning stages of creating. This site will be referenced on all job applications and my resume. It is intended to highlight my web development skills on its own, as well as to showcase other notable programming accomplishments and projects. I'm excited to make this my best web project yet!
